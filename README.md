"# AC-ESP-C-" 

-Fetch all the offsets needed to make the ESP.

-Implement the calculations on the View Projection Matrix to keep track of the entities.

-Find the Processor Id and the Module Base Adress Dynamically. 

-Use the Windows API to Read and Write memory to the program and draw boxes around entities.

-Set the colors in function of if the entitiy is an ally or enemy.

*****To Do****
- Auto Aim
- Write names of the entities above their boxes
- No recoil
- IMGUI interface

// Review for Myself
I learned many things in this small project. The process of reverse engineering and translating the data found is very interesting. Before proceeding with other projects, I believe it is in my best interest to learn OpenGL and 3D graphics, since there is a lot of math involved, including trigonometry, matrices, and vectors, which I need to master to improve the results. Finally, I will continue to use C++ for these projects since it is a low-level language and allows direct use of the Windows API
